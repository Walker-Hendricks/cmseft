PLEASE move this entire directory to: `../generation/genproductions/bin/MadGraph5_aMCatNLO/addons/models/SMEFTsim_topU3l_MwScheme_UFO/`

You can also delete this README file. You will need to edit this depending on whether you're doing a process besides $ttZ$, but if you're here I'm assuming you know that already.

From the home directory, run this:
```bash
rm default/README.md
mv default generation/genproductions/bin/MadGraph5_aMCatNLO/addons/models/SMEFTsim_topU3l_MwScheme_UFO/default
```
